# Eye-Rotation

This Project has two eyes which follows the mouse movement. Both the eyes are synchronised to follow the directions of mouse pointer. It looks like a person following the mouse. The mouse movement event is used to update the position of the "eye" element displayed on the page. Mouse events are a popular way to bind the DOM elements to events.

## Future Work
This Project can be further enhanced by opening and closing the eyes based mouse click.
